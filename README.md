# htn-organizer-2018
the hack the north challenge for Backend

# Start the App
```python app.py```

# Populate the DB
hit: 
`http://localhost:5000/new` then `http://localhost:5000/fill`

### To clear: 
`https://localhost:5000/clear`

# API Endpoints
As mentioned in the Gist.

# Important Points
There lacks a "country" column as none of the data included a valid "country" value. I suspect this was a mistake and indicated as such in the comments.

# Thank you!!
